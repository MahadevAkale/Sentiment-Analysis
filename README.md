# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Logistic Regression. The dataset used is the **Sentiment140 dataset** from Kaggle, which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled with sentiment (positive or negative).

# Project Overview

In this project, the goal is to classify tweets as positive or negative using a machine learning approach. The data preprocessing pipeline involves text cleaning, stemming, and vectorization. The machine learning model used for sentiment prediction is Logistic Regression.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the **Sentiment140 dataset**. This dataset contains 1.6 million tweets with the following attributes:
- target: Sentiment label (0 for negative, 1 for positive)
- id: Tweet ID
- date: Date and time the tweet was posted
- flag: Review label
- user: Username of the person who posted the tweet
- text: The tweet content

The dataset is preprocessed to remove emoticons and is used to build the sentiment classifier.

### Dataset Download

The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle using the `kaggle` API. Ensure that you have your `kaggle.json` API key file for authentication.
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140
To download the dataset, run:
```bash
!kaggle datasets download -d kazanova/sentiment140
```

# Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `re`
- `nltk`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pickle`
- `kaggle`

To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should contain:
```txt
numpy
pandas
re
nltk
scikit-learn
pickle
kaggle
```

# Data Preprocessing

The data is loaded from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. The preprocessing steps include:
1. Handling missing values: Any missing values are dropped.
2. Text cleaning: Removing non-alphabetic characters.
3. Stemming: Using the Porter Stemming algorithm to reduce words to their root form.
4. Target Label Transformation: Changing the sentiment label from `4` to `1` for positive sentiment.

# Model Training

The text data is converted into numerical data using the *TF-IDF Vectorizer*. The training data is then used to train a *Logistic Regression* model with the following steps:
1. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets (80% training, 20% testing).
2. Vectorizing the text data using the `TfidfVectorizer`.
3. Training the Logistic Regression model on the training data.

```python
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

# Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores on both the training and testing datasets. The accuracy score is computed using `accuracy_score` from *scikit-learn*.

```python
training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_train, x_train_prediction)
test_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, x_test_prediction)
```

# Model Saving and Prediction

Once the model is trained, it is saved using *pickle* to persist the trained model for future use.

# Saving the Model:
```python
filename = 'trained_model.sav'
pickle.dump(model, open(filename, 'wb'))
```

# Using the Saved Model:
```python
loaded_model = pickle.load(open('trained_model.sav', 'rb'))
x_test_prediction = loaded_model.predict(x_test)
```

## How to Run the Code

1. **Set up Kaggle API Key**: Place your `kaggle.json` file in the correct directory (`~/.kaggle/`).
2. **Install dependencies**: Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libraries.
3. **Run the script**: Execute the Python code step-by-step or as a whole to train the model and evaluate its performance.
